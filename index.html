               <h2 class = "question"> What is FL Studio?</h2>
               <p id = "slightlylargertext">FL Studio is a DAW, or Digital Audio Workstation, which is an application used to produce, edit, record, or generally modify your own 
                  music or audio, developed by Image-line.
                  While there are other popular options, FL Studio is the most prolific DAW due to its relative ease of use and catalog of very in depth tutorials. The 
                  program is also very powerful, resulting in it being used by beginners, hobbyists and industry proffessionals alike.

               <h2>Acquiring FL Studio</h2>
               <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">FL Studio is acquired like most other software. You can purchase it through Image-line's website at <a href="https://www.image-line.com"> https://www.image-line.com</a> 
                  , where a free demo is also provided to allow you to test the software before purchase. You can also purchase the software for cheaper through many different third
                  party websites. Many people will recommend pirating the software due to its high cost (Usually &gt 100$), though I can't recommend this due to the high risk of infecting your computer
                  with malicious viruses or spyware, dubious legality not withstanding.

               <h2>FL Studio upon opening</h2>
               <p>Upon opening FL Studio you are greeted with a UI that can be quite overwhelming with those unfamiliar with DAWs. Learning this UI can be difficult if done without
                  tutorials, so I recommend watching them if you plan to start using the software. The best way to decipher the UI is to take it piece by piece, understanding only
                  the parts you need to understand to do what you want to in the moment. I've used the program for multiple years and I still fairly commonly discover some feature
                  or keyboard shortcut that I've never used before.

               <h2>VST Plugins</h2>
               <p>A VST, short for Virtual Audio Technology, is essentially the life blood of music production along with sampling and recording. VSTs allow you to create sounds from
                  scratch within FL Studio, not requiring you to record your own audio or download someone else's audio online. There are thousands if not tens of thousands of VSTs 
                  available across the internet, but most producers tend to gravitate towards a half dozen or so of their favorites and occasionally leave their comfort zone for sounds
                  that they'd have trouble making with their common choices. VSTs, like FL Studio, can be quite expensive, so many newer producers use the plugins included with FL Studio and
                  free plugins found online.

               <h2>Effect Plugins</h2>
               <p>Effect plugins are plugins that modify sounds outputted by VST plugins or samples dropped directly into FL Studio. There are a plethora of these that come native 
                  to FL Studio that producers of every skill level utilize quite often, and many more free and paid third party effects that are popular as well. These plugins allow
                  you to further modify a sound outside the scope of most VSTs by adding effects such as distortion, reverb or delay, allowing you to boost &amp subdue certain frequencies
                  in your sound, and many more specialized effects specific to certain plugins.
